To keep your website safe, it comes with built in **spam and bot protection**, by using Akisment and reCaptcha for messages sent by visitors. The plugin is continuously improved and used on live websites since 2012.

th23 Contact is built with some few goals in mind:

* **Simple and straight forward** option for user to contact you
* **Light-weight code basis** without overheads and frameworks
* **Easy to adapt styling** to fit any page design and layout
* **Fight spam and bots** without unnecessary hurdles (admittedly it\'s a compromise)
