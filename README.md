Simple contact form via block or legacy shortcode with optional spam protection via Akismet and reCaptcha


## üöÄ Introduction

Provide your users and visitors a **simple and straight forward contact form**.

The **modern design** is very clear, easy to navigate and with light-weight JS and CSS code. One big benefit is its **flexible positioning** in pages and posts as a **modern style block or classic shortcode**.

To keep your website safe, it comes with built in **spam and bot protection**, by using Akisment and reCaptcha for messages sent by visitors. The plugin is continuously improved and used on live websites since 2012.

th23 Contact is built with some few goals in mind:

* **Simple and straight forward** option for user to contact you
* **Light-weight code basis** without overheads and frameworks
* **Easy to adapt styling** to fit any page design and layout
* **Fight spam and bots** without unnecessary hurdles (admittedly it's a compromise)

## ‚ùì FAQ

### Q: Despite reCaptcha being activated, **I receive many spam contact messages**? ###

A: reCaptcha is around for a long time and available in various versions. Its version 2 was added to this plugin some years ago. Unfortunately with latest advances in computing, **it has to be considered "broken" by now**.

Since version 3.1.0 of this plugin, there is (additionally) the **option to use Akismet to detect spam**. It uses a much broader approach and thus for now seems to show significatly better detection of spam. **Activate it on the plugins settings page**.

### Q: Can the plugin be activated on **multiple selected pages / posts only**? ###

A: You can enable the block / shortcode for selected pages / posts only to **save your users unnecessarily loading JavaScript and CSS files**.

But for convenience the `th23 Contact` block / `[th23-contact]` shortcode can also be enabled for `All pages`, `All posts` or an selected set of pages / posts. Simply visit the plugin settings in your admin area. Under "Pages / Posts" you have the free choice.

To select multiple items on a PC simply keep the "Ctrl" key pressed any click on the pages / posts you want to select.
